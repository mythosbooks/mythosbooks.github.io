Everyone is overjoyed with her work, except the President- and in a world where her word is the only one that matters, Sarah might as well be just another peasant. Though she tries to keep her head down and do her work, she stumbles upon a terrible secret, one that sends her on the run through her beloved forced, a squad of government-employed poisoners following her every step, releasing chemicals into the air that can destroy villages and caue entire acres to shrivel up and die.

            <p>England, 1862. Darwin’s theories have rocked the world, no more so than at Oxford University, where a group of ambitious young naturalists are forced to reevaluate everything they thought was true. In the pursuit of knowledge, the group sets sail down the Amazon River to create a document heretofore thought impossible: a comprehensive list of all creatures in the area. It is there that they make a shocking discovery, a cover of mermaids who defy the natural world and the ideals of science all in one.  If the two groups are two survive, they have to learn to trust each other.</p>
