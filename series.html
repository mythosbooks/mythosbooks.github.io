            <p>Despite her youth, Sarah White has quickly become one of the government’s most promising young employees following the great war, rising through the ranks of the Forestry Department, where she tries to salvage what is left of her country’s beautiful woodlands. Everyone is overjoyed with her work, except the President- and in a world where her word is the only one that matters, Sarah might as well be just another peasant. Though she tries to keep her head down and do her work, she stumbles upon a terrible secret, one that sends her on the run through her beloved forced, a squad of government-employed poisoners following her every step, releasing chemicals into the air that can destroy villages and caue entire acres to shrivel up and die. Will Sarah use her information for good? Or will she let her fellow citizens, not to mention the woods she loves, perish?</p>
            
            <p>Praise for <i>Slow Poison</i> and Margaret Peterson Haddix:</p>
            <p>“Refreshing and fascinating take on a tale near and dear to our hearts.” -Helen Oyeyemi, author of <i>Boy Snow Bird</i></p>
            <p>“Slow Poison takes the glitter out of fairytales and adds suspense and action.” -Ernest Cline, author of <i>Ready Player One</i></p>
            <p>For <i>Palace of Mirrors</i>: "Haddix is no stranger to best-seller lists, and she has another hit on her hands with the Palace Chronicles. Buy multiple copies, and expect eager, advance requests for them." -Booklist</p>
           
           <p>Other stories in the <i>After Ever After</i> series include the following titles. Release dates to come!</p>
           
           <p><i>Sensation</i></p>
           <p><i>Sensation</i> brings readers to a world just as deadly as the one in <i>Slow Poison</i>, where happy endings are just as hard to find. Following her father’s murder, Callie, the young queen, has managed to maintain control of the kingdom that rightfully belongs to her- but just barely. Cursed with highly acute senses since birth, Callie can sense any disturbance in her new domain- any fights among the people, any pain and hunger, and any threats to her power. Its up to Callie whether she uses this ability to help a Kingdom that needs her, or tighten her grip on it.</p>
           
           <p><i>The Bargain</i></p>
           <p>Ron Stiltskin always knew the economy would collapse, he just didn’t expect it to happen so soon. While everyone around him is floundering, their lives in tatters, Ron finds himself in a plum position as the overseer of a workshop full of women due to some bureaucratic connections in the new government. Ron finds himself a rich man surrounded by poor women who would do almost anything to escape from the world he has trapped them in. Penelope Goodwin is one his employees, pregnant, bitter, and suspicious of her new boss. How is it that women enter his office one day and leave the next? What is their secret, and what is the “agreement” she hears the other women whispering about?In her attempts to escape through the system of work and sacrifice Ron has set up, she finds herself trapped in a deadly game- one that might cost her the only thing she has left.</p>
           
           <p><i>Awakening</i></p>
           <p>Ryan Van Winkle hates being woken up, and thinks that he has finally earned a right to sleep in peace. Following the realization that in middle age he’s still living in the small town he grew up in and no closer to the dreams of fame and admiration he’s longed for since he was a geeky kid with his nose buried in Arthurian tales of glory. When he settles under an old tree expecting a quick nap, he ends up sleeping for a little longer than intended; about a hundred years longer, to be precise. Upon waking up, Ryan founds himself squarely in the center of the greatest disaster the world has ever known- and in a hundred years there have been a lot of disasters. Mistaken for an oracle, Ryan seems to have found his last chance to live out his dreams- at least until his cover is blown and everyone knows he’s nothing but a loser. A novel that proves sometimes you just need to wake up on the right side of the bed in order to change everything, <i>Awakening</i> is a satirical and fantastical romp through one of the world’s most beloved stories.</p>
