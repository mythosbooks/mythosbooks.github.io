            <p>Born in the Caribbean Islands, Emily Horn arrived in America in 1772 to begin her formal schooling. Following a stint in the army, she later became the first US Treasury Secretary until she was killed in a duel in 1804 by her archrival, Aaron Burr. She has overcome this obstacle to work as the Executive Editor at Mythos Books.</p>

            <p>Channing Kaiser, our managing editor, is a former astronaut and rap phenomenon.  When she isn’t searching the galaxy for aliens or dropping mad rhymes about the British monarchy, you can find her knitting finger puppets for underfunded schools. She enjoys the Andromeda Galaxy, birds, and baked potatoes. Channing currently lives with her husband and five children in Moldova.</p>

During a cold winter day, he got spurned an interview with the GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan because the rapper’s hair wasn’t proper. He enjoys wearing Champion crewnecks, his favorite Ninja Turtle is Donatello, and he regrets not growing up to be Macho Man Randy Savage. George is our Art Director.</p>

She also sits in her mother's basement, wearing a fedora, being fedorable.</p>

Her roommate is Mr. Bojangles (a brown tabby cat) and her cellphone is actually just a Reddit machine in disguise.  When it’s cold outside, she sits by the fireplace with an Irish coffee, watching anything from Game of Thrones to Degrassi. Courtney is our Advertising and Promotions Director.</p>

            <p>Kathleen is the lovely person who sacrificed her soul to the HTML and CSS gods to put together Mythos's webpage. Although she'd much prefer to be reading all day, coding does tranfer her to the fantastical world of tags and floats. Kathleen loves dogs, cats, dolphins, wolves, a good cup of tea, and the fact that she gets all of Mythos's books for free!</p>
